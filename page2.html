<h2> <b>Entry Two </b></h2>

<p>So, I am clearly not used to this journaling  thing a whole semester has passed me by and now im doing the final project. This semester was absoluteky the hardest, feeling like I walked into a trap with this semsester i tried my hardest to show up to every class and give my undevided attention to all of them.  </p>
